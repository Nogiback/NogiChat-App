[NodeJS - Messaging App Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-messaging-app)

This is one of the final full stack projects under the Fullstack Javascript Development curriculum for The Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to create a simple chat messaging application similar to Discord, Whatsapp, or Facebook Messenger. The application must implement features such as authorization, user-to-user messaging, and user profile customization.

## Built With

Frontend: Typescript, React, React Router, Vite, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Axios, Zustand

Backend: Javascript, NodeJS, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Socket.io, JWT, Bcrypt.

## Lessons Learned

Backend: The biggest lesson I learned on the backend for this application was working with Socket.io and setting up real-time communication between my client and server. I also got to solidify my experience with setting up a RESTful API including user auth, password hashing, and database queries.

Frontend: On the client side, I learned a few new things. I decided to use a state management library instead of fully relying on React's useState hook. I chose to learn Zustand as it seemed to have the most straightforward and user friendly API. I also decided to use more custom hooks for this application as I mostly relied on useEffects in a lot of my components in previous projects. It's a nice and modular technique and doesn't bog down my TSX/JSX files. I also solidifed my TailwindCSS experience by using DaisyUI. It definitely helped with the readability of my code using semantic class names.

I also decided to deploy my application on Render and definitely pulled some hairs getting the deployment to work. Detailed error messages and Stackoverlow, thank you <3
